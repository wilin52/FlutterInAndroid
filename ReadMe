Add Flutter as a module.

The way use flutter:
1. Activity extends FlutterActivity,  see FlutterDemoActivity;
2. add 'Flutter.startInitialization(this)' into application , see FlutterDemoApplication;

debug or profile mode is ok,but release not works.
the problem is:
values of window.physicalSize.width/height and window.devicePixelRatio are wrong.
